I am a graduate student and researcher at the University of Wyoming, specializing in Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Edge Computing. My work focuses on developing advanced AI models that integrate multi-modal data—including visual, textual, and auditory inputs—to enable machines to understand and respond to complex visual cues. I have contributed to projects that enhance system efficiency and real-time analysis through data integration from IoT devices, and I have developed AI models for applications like wildlife detection and behavior analysis. With experience spanning both academia and industry, I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of AI and Computer Vision.
